- Add lighweight Views display type with with no (or very simple) Entity row
  style. Also, limit the EntityListHandlerViews to only make views of that
  display available. This will make Views a pure query backend.

- Add a configuration per context instance to set a limit on the query.

- Add a context relationship that extracts a limit and offset from an executed
  list. Thus adding the possibility to execute on query and pass different
  chunks of it, to different Mini Panels etc.

- Add content type for a whole list.
